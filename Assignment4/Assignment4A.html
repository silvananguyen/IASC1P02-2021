      <h3>Early Life</h3>
			<p>
				Bong was the youngest of four children. His father was a graphic designer and an art teacher, and his maternal grandfather was a noted novelist who had chosen to move to North Korea during the Korean War. When Bong was in elementary school, he moved with his family from Taegu to Seoul. He developed an interest in film while in secondary school. He then enrolled at Yonsei University, where he studied sociology and worked on the campus newspaper, drawing cartoons that supported the pro-democracy movement. After performing compulsory military service for two years, he graduated in 1993. He then enrolled at the Korean Academy of Film Arts, where he experienced all aspects of filmmaking. Bong spent the next several years contributing in various ways, mostly writing, to movies of other directors.

	    <h3>Career</h3>
			<p>
				After graduating, he spent the next five years contributing in various capacities to works by other directors. He received a partial screenplay credit on the anthology film Seven Reasons Why Beer is Better Than a Lover (1996); both screenplay and assistant director credits on Park Ki-yong's debut Motel Cactus (1997); and is one of four writers (along with Jang Joon-hwan) credited for the screenplay of Phantom: The Submarine (1999). He first became known to audiences and achieved a cult following with his directorial debut film, the black comedy Barking Dogs Never Bite (2000), before achieving both critical and commercial success with his subsequent films: the crime thriller Memories of Murder (2003), the monster film The Host (2006), the science fiction action film Snowpiercer (2013), and the black comedy thriller Parasite (2019), all of which are among the highest-grossing films in South Korea, with Parasite also being the highest-grossing South Korean film in history.

			<h3>Inspirations</h3>
			<p>
				As a child, Bong watched Black Orpheus (1959), which made a big impact on him, on Korean television. While he was in film school, Bong watched the Qatsi trilogy (1982–2002). His main inspirations are from Guillermo del Toro—his favorite films of del Toro's are The Devil's Backbone (2001) and Pan's Labyrinth (2006) and Nagisa Ōshima, describing Oshima as "one of the most controversial masters". Bong also studied the films of Martin Scorsese and cited him as one of his major influences during his acceptance speech for the Academy Award for Best Director when he won for Parasite (2019). His process when working with actors is to make them feel comfortable and gives them a high amount of freedom when performing, even allowing them to improvise. Bong has commented that he doesn't like the term 'Directing Actors' as he feels that "acting is the actor's job and it's something I don't feel like I can direct". The most defining trademark of Bong's films are their sudden tone shifts (sometimes within scenes) between drama, darkness, and black or slapstick humor. Bong claimed: "I'm never really conscious of the tone shifts or the comedy that I apply, I never think 'oh, the tone shifts at this point or it's funny at this point.' I'm never conscious of it during the filmmaking or screenwriting process."
