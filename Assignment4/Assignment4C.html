			I liked how the director tried to keep the real killer as anonymous as possible by having multiple actors of similar physicality appear as the murderer interchangeably, so the viewer would never be left with clearly defined characteristics.

	***SPOILERS AHEAD*** This movie is based on what the director has described as "the first real case of serial murder in Korea": between 1986 and 1991, the rural area of Hwaseong was terrorized by the killings of ten women. In the end of the movie, the detective (actor) looked up where the audience can see so much emotion conveyed in that final look. This powerful scene was shot as the director said he knew the criminal would come to watch his film and laugh at how he was never caught. In 2019, the idenitity of the real-life killer finally came to light as he confessed to the Hwaseong homicides. CASE CLOSED.
