    <h2 class="magentaHeader">Opinions on the Main Characters</h2>
    <h3 class="blueHeader">Josee</h3>
    <p>What really fascinated about the lead female character, Josee was that even though she had a disability she still strived to reach her potential in art and reading books to children. With disabled characters, it’s easy to craft a narrative of pitty or one where the character only sees themselves as a “burden.” In Josee case, she chose to learn how to become independent and navigate the world on her own.</p>
    <h3 class="blueHeader">Tsuneo</h3>
    <p>In the beginning, when Tsuneo was Josee's caretaker, he doesn’t describe Josee as anything other than being stubborn and fierce. He sees her for her and even when a romantic rival says that he was only by Josee’s side, the audience knows that Tsuneo isn’t pitting her. Because of Josee, Tsuneo becomes connected to her and eventually falls in love with her. Their bond is beautiful not only because of the common romance elements, but because the two are connected by a thread of mutual respect and admiration. It’s what makes their love story one of growth and belonging and allows the film to hit as hard as it does.</p>

    <h2 class="magentaHeader">Why I give this movie a rating of 5/5 :)</h2>
    <p>I personally love on how well the director captivated the plot. The story paints the beauty of love showing scenes of kindness, warmness, and caring between the two lead characters. The character of tsuneo is mature, calm and practical. Where the character of the Josse is an artist, she lives in her own different world, she creates every scene. Both of them see sea as different, from thier own point of view. They give each other wings to FLY. Tsuneo helps Josse to live her life, while Josse helps Tsuneo to grow his wings back. This story is from those one in a million that doesn't show to sacrifice your dreams for love. It shows you can still fly with ur wings if ur partner supports you.</p>
